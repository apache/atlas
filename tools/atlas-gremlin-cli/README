Introduction
  atlas-gremlin-cli is a small command-line utility to run Gremlin queries against Atlas' embedded JanusGraph backend.

  It uses Atlas' normal configuration loading, so it requires:
    -Datlas.conf=/path/to/atlas/conf

Setup
  - Extract the tarball from distro/target/apache-atlas-<version>-atlas-gremlin-cli.tar.gz
  - Set the ATLAS_CONF environment variable to the path to the Atlas configuration directory.
  - Set the ATLAS_CLASSPATH environment variable to the path to the dependency jars.
  - Run the atlas-gremlin-cli.sh script.

Run
  export ATLAS_CONF=/etc/atlas/conf
  export ATLAS_CLASSPATH="/path/to/dependency/jars/*"
  ./atlas-gremlin-cli.sh -q "g.V().limit(5).valueMap(true).toList()"
  or
  ./atlas-gremlin-cli.sh -f /path/to/query.groovy

Notes
  - Default behavior is to rollback the transaction (safe for read-only). Use --commit to persist mutations.
  - For best output, end queries with .toList() or .next() or similar materialization.
