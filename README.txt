Apache Atlas Overview
=====================

Apache Atlas framework is an extensible set of core
foundational governance services â€“ enabling enterprises to effectively and
efficiently meet their compliance requirements within Hadoop and allows
integration with the whole enterprise data ecosystem.

This will provide true visibility in Hadoop by using both a prescriptive
and forensic model, along with technical and operational audit as well as
lineage enriched by business taxonomical metadata.  It also enables any
metadata consumer to work inter-operably without discrete interfaces to
each other -- the metadata store is common.

The metadata veracity is maintained by leveraging Apache Ranger to prevent
non-authorized access paths to data at runtime.
Security is both role based (RBAC) and attribute based (ABAC).


Build Process
=============
0. Get keycloak dependency
   $ mkdir -p ~/.m2/repository/org/keycloak
   $ wget https://atlan-public.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/artifact/keycloak-15.0.2.1.zip
   $ unzip -o keycloak-15.0.2.1.zip -d ~/.m2/repository/org


1. Get Atlas sources to your local directory, for example with following commands
   $ cd <your-local-directory>
   $ git clone https://github.com/apache/atlas.git
   $ cd atlas

   # Checkout the branch or tag you would like to build
   #
   # to checkout a branch
     $ git checkout <branch>

   # to checkout a tag
     $ git checkout tags/<tag>

2. Execute the following commands to build Apache Atlas
   $ export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms2g -Xmx2g"
   $ mvn clean install
   $ mvn clean package -Pdist

3. After above build commands successfully complete, you should see the following files
   distro/target/apache-atlas-<version>-bin.tar.gz
   distro/target/apache-atlas-<version>-hbase-hook.tar.gz
   distro/target/apache-atlas-<version>-hive-hook.tar.gz
   distro/target/apache-atlas-<version>-impala-hook.tar.gz
   distro/target/apache-atlas-<version>-kafka-hook.tar.gz
   distro/target/apache-atlas-<version>-server.tar.gz
   distro/target/apache-atlas-<version>-sources.tar.gz
   distro/target/apache-atlas-<version>-sqoop-hook.tar.gz
   distro/target/apache-atlas-<version>-storm-hook.tar.gz
   distro/target/apache-atlas-<version>-falcon-hook.tar.gz
